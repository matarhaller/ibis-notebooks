    "What is Ibis?\n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "Ibis is a Python-based analytics framework, inspired by the pandas API and other successful tabular data manipulation toolkits, designed to use remote executions engines to provide speed and scalability for large distributed data sets. At the moment, we are focused on **Impala** as the execution engine for Ibis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project breaks down into a number of logical components that fit together\n",
    "\n",
    "- A domain specific language, or **DSL** (as we'll call it henceforth), for describing data transformations, analytics, ETL, and any other dataset or system manipulation steps. This is a fancy way of saying \"a Python library with classes and functions that provide a higher level mode of expresison\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tools to support workflows involving data ingest, ETL, caching, database view creation, and so forth. We aim to free the user from some of the low-level details of interacting with analytical data stores and get you focused on the actual data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Future: Powerful user-defined function support within the Ibis DSL. This will also require some customizations to the execution engine (i.e. Impala) to be supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Future: Use the Ibis DSL with in-database machine learning toolkits like MADLib\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ibis DSL aims for several goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remote computation from a local Python compute session\n",
    "- Composability; easy to chain together operations and build pipelines\n",
    "- Integration with pandas and other Python libraries\n",
    "- Semantic completeness: support any operations possible in the underlying compute systems, e.g. Impala SQL\n",
    "- Validation as you go: catch you making mis-steps right away, if possible\n",
    "- Ease of code reuse"

    "Installation\n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "To install ibis, use `pip` (or `easy_install`, but `pip` is really better). To install ibis from source clone the repository and run the `setup.py` script:\n",

    "    > git clone https://github.com/cloudera/ibis.git\n",
    "    > cd ibis\n",
